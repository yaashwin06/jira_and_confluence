<!-- # Jira Project Generator - Company-Managed Projects

A Python automation tool that creates fully structured Jira company-managed projects with Epics, Stories, and project-specific custom fields.

## What It Does

This script automates the creation of Jira projects with:

- **Company-managed projects** (Kanban, Scrum, or Bug Tracking templates)
- **Pre-defined project structure** with Epics and Stories for migration projects
- **Custom fields** scoped specifically to your project:
  - % Complete
  - Target Start Date
  - Target End Date
  - Owning (User picker)
- **Automatic linking** of Stories to their parent Epics
- **Smart field scoping** ensures custom fields only appear in the created project

## Project Structure Created

The script generates a complete migration project structure with 5 main Epics:

1. **ASSESSMENT & PLANNING** (36 stories)
2. **TEST MIGRATION** (8 stories)
3. **USER ACCEPTANCE TESTING** (4 stories)
4. **PRODUCTION MIGRATION** (2 stories)
5. **POST MIGRATION SUPPORT** (1 story)

Total: **5 Epics** and **51 Stories** with custom field values pre-populated.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Python Version
- Python 3.7 or higher

### 2. Required Packages

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv
```


### 3. Jira API Token

You need a Jira API token to authenticate:

1. Go to [Atlassian API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click **Create API token**
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Jira Project Generator")
4. Copy the generated token

### 4. Jira Permissions

Your Jira account must have:
- Permission to create projects
- Permission to create custom fields
- Project administrator access

## Installation

1. **Download the script:**
   ```bash
   # Save the script as jira_project_generator.py
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install requests python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Create configuration file:**

   The script will automatically create a `.env` template file on first run, or you can create it manually:

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

4. **Configure credentials:**

   Edit the `.env` file with your Jira details:

   ```env
   # Jira Configuration
   JIRA_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.atlassian.net
   JIRA_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
   JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
   ```

   **Replace:**
   - `your-domain` with your actual Jira domain
   - `your-email@example.com` with your Jira account email
   - `your_api_token_here` with your API token from step 3

## Usage

### Running the Script

```bash
python jira_project_generator.py
```

### Interactive Prompts

The script will guide you through the setup:

#### 1. **Project Name**
```
Enter Project Name: My Migration Project
```

#### 2. **Project Key**
```
Enter Project Key (suggested: MMPR): MMPR
```
- Must be 2-10 uppercase letters/numbers
- Must start with a letter
- Must be unique across your Jira instance

#### 3. **Template Selection**
```
SELECT PROJECT TEMPLATE (Company-managed)

  1. Kanban
  2. Scrum
  3. Bug Tracking

Choose template (1-3) [default: 2-Scrum]: 2
```

#### 4. **Review and Confirm**
```
SUMMARY

  Project Name:  My Migration Project
  Project Key:   MMPR
  Template:      Scrum (Company-managed)
  Epics:         5
  Stories:       51
  Custom Fields: 4 (scoped to this project)

Proceed with creation? (y/N): y
```

### What Happens Next

The script will:

1. ✅ Test connection to Jira
2. ✅ Create the company-managed project
3. ✅ Create/configure 4 custom fields
4. ✅ Scope custom fields to your project only
5. ✅ Add custom fields to project screens
6. ✅ Create 5 Epics
7. ✅ Create 51 Stories linked to Epics
8. ✅ Populate custom field values

### Expected Output

```

   https://your-domain.atlassian.net/projects/MMPR
```

## Custom Fields Created

The script creates these custom fields scoped to your project:

| Field Name | Type | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| % Complete | Text Field | Track completion percentage |
| Target Start Date | Date Picker | Set target start date |
| Target End Date | Date Picker | Set target end date |
| Owning | User Picker | Assign task owner |

**Note:** These fields are scoped exclusively to your project and won't appear in other projects.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Connection failed"
- Verify your `.env` credentials
- Check if your Jira instance URL is correct
- Ensure your API token is valid

### Error: "Project key already exists"
- Choose a different project key
- Check existing projects at: `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/projects`

### Error: "Failed to create field"
- Verify you have admin permissions
- Check if field names already exist globally
- Review Jira field limits for your instance

### Error: "Failed to create Epic/Story"
- Check issue type scheme for your project
- Verify Epic issue type is enabled
- Review project permissions

### Custom fields not appearing
- Check project screens configuration
- Verify field context is properly set
- May need to manually add to screens if auto-config fails

## Customization

### Modifying the Project Structure

Edit the `EPICS` dictionary in the script to customize your structure:

```python
EPICS = {
    "Your Epic Name": [
        "Story 1",
        "Story 2",
        "Story 3"
    ],
    "Another Epic": [
        "Story A",
        "Story B"
    ]
}
```

### Adding Custom Fields

Edit the `EXPECTED_FIELDS` dictionary:

```python
EXPECTED_FIELDS = {
    "your_field_key": {
        "name": "Your Field Name",
        "field_id": None,
        "type": "com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.customfieldtypes:textfield",
        "searcherKey": "com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.customfieldtypes:textsearcher",
        "description": "Your field description"
    }
}
```

Common field types:
- `textfield` - Single line text
- `textarea` - Multi-line text
- `datepicker` - Date field
- `userpicker` - User selection
- `select` - Dropdown list

## Security Notes

- **Never commit your `.env` file** to version control
- Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file
- Rotate API tokens periodically
- Use tokens with minimum required permissions

## Limitations

- Only works with company-managed projects
- Creates a specific migration project structure
- Custom field names are fixed (can be customized in code)
- Requires admin-level permissions for custom fields
- Maximum field context limitations apply per Jira instance

## Support

For issues with:
- **The script**: Review error messages and check troubleshooting section
- **Jira API**: Consult [Atlassian REST API documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/)
- **Permissions**: Contact your Jira administrator
